# Kinematics-Data-Analysis
This group project for STA 160 at UC Davis analyzes kinematic motion data to predict whether a person is walking or running. Using acceleration values
and location coordinates, I was responsible for the exploratory data analysis and model building portions of the project. I constructed three dimensional
plots to analyze the differences between walking and running. Additionally, I utilized logistic regression, logistic generalized additive model, and
neural networks to build the best model for the data.
